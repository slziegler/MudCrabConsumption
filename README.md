## Title: Influence of salt marsh edge morphology on cross-boundary consumption and prey density

**Authors:** Grace Gibbs, Emlyn J. Resetarits, and Shelby L. Ziegler

**Abstract:** The configuration of habitats within a landscape can influence how species move across habitat boundaries and subsequently alter species interactions within a landscape. Although most studies have focused on how habitat fragmentation directly affects species diversity and predator-prey interactions, the alteration of the habitat edge morphology may also influence how species move across these boundaries and thus species interactions and overall food web dynamics. In this study, we investigated the role of salt marsh edge geomorphology, in mediating consumption rates on mud crabs (Panopeus obesus) and mud crab density across the tidal creek-salt marsh boundary. We conducted consumption assays with tethered mud crabs at three distinct edge morphologies: 1) naturally sloping banks (slopes), 2) actively eroding slump blocks (slumps) and 3) highly eroded vertical escarpments (scarps). We then quantified mud crab densities on the marsh platform at each edge type. We found that consumption at slumps was ~15% lower than at either slopes or scarps. We also determined that mud crab densities were 2x higher at slumps than slopes or scarps. Combined these results suggest that small-scales differences in edge morphology affect the access and use of the marsh platform by estuarine predators potentially dampening the flow of energy across this habitat boundary. Continued sea level rise and higher frequency of intense storm events should increase eroding slump blocks, potentially causing shifts in trophic interactions and subsequent energy flow to estuarine species that rely on these spatially-coupled food webs.
